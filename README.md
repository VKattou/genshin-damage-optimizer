# Genshin Impact damage optimizer
Personal project that started out as a simple damage calculator, but got repurposed to help optimize equipment choices.

By adding character data, weapons and artifacts, you can generate a sorted list of damage calculations for each combination of equipment, making it easy to decide on the best equipment for your characters.

Unfortunately it's all backend, so you'll have to program each piece of equipment manually, if you want to make use of the optimizer yourself.
